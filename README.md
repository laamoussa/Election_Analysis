Project Overview: The main purpose of the project is to complete the election audit of the recent local congressional election in Colorado. To provide the result of the election, we were directed to use the PyPoll_Challenge .py and the election_result.csv to calculate the total votes cast in the congressional election. We are also asking to break down the number of votes, the percentage of each county, and to calculate the county with the largest number of votes. Finally, to provide the percentages of the total votes each candidate received, the winner, their votes, and the percentages of the total votes. We were provided the PyPoll_Challenge .py and the electione_result.csv via python and Visual Studio Code software.

Script: The script provides the complete picture of the congressional election. It gives the election result of each county and the candidates. It also provides the winner in each county and winners in the three precincts. With some modifications, such as the changes of candidates' names and candidates' identities, the script can be modified for other elections. While candidate varies from years to years, the county remains the same over a long period unless there is re-distribution of the county that normally happened every decade.
